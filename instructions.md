## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to give students an understanding of rule-based AI systems, which operate using logical rules or heuristics rather than machine learning. By the end of the project, students will:

- Understand how AI systems worked before machine learning became widespread.
- Learn how to design and implement rule-based systems using Python.
- Gain experience interacting with AI tools to iteratively develop a solution.

## Project Overview

You will work in stages to design and implement a rule-based AI system. Examples of such systems include:

- A simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules.
- A recipe recommendation system that suggests recipes based on ingredients entered by the user.
- A diagnostic assistant that provides basic troubleshooting advice for a problem (e.g., fixing a broken device).

In this assignment, you will:

1. Use an AI assistant to brainstorm project ideas and select one.
2. Collaborate with the AI assistant to write Python code for your rule-based system.
3. Test and refine your system.

## Part 1: Prompting the AI for Project Ideas

Begin by asking an AI assistant (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) to suggest ideas for rule-based systems. Use a prompt similar to this:

> "I am working on a Python project to create a simple AI system based on rules or heuristics. This is for an assignment where I need to understand how AI worked before machine learning. Could you suggest 
> some project ideas for a rule-based AI system? Please include examples like chatbots, recommendation systems, or diagnostic tools."

- Write down at least three project ideas suggested by the AI.
- For each idea, briefly describe:
    - What the system does (e.g., a chatbot for restaurant recommendations).
    - How it would work using rules (e.g., predefined responses based on keywords).
- Select the project idea that most interests you and provide a 2-3 sentence justification for your choice.

## Part 2: Designing Your Rule-Based System

Once you’ve chosen your project idea, prompt the AI to help you design the rules or heuristics for the system. Use a prompt like this:

> "I want to create a [insert your system idea here]. The system will be rule-based. Can you help me outline the rules and logic needed to make this work? For example, what conditions or keywords should I 
> check for, and what responses or actions should my system take?"

- Write down the rules and logic suggested by the AI.
- Organize the rules into a clear list (e.g., IF-THEN statements or pseudocode).

## Part 3: Coding Your Rule-Based System

Now it’s time to implement the system. Use the AI to assist with writing and debugging the Python code. Here’s an example of an initial prompt:

> "I need help writing Python code for a rule-based system. The system I want to build is a [insert your project idea here], and here are the rules I’ve outlined: [list your rules]. Could you help me
> write the Python code for this?"

As you interact with the AI:

- Collaboratively build the code.
- Refine the code based on feedback or errors encountered.
- Ensure the AI helps you understand the code and its functionality.

### Requirements for Your Code:

1. The system should include:
    - User input (e.g., input() function).
    - Rule-based decision-making using conditionals (if-elif-else statements).
    - Outputs based on the rules (e.g., text responses or recommendations).
2. Include comments explaining how the rules are implemented.
3. Test the system with multiple user inputs to ensure it works as intended.

## Part 4: Reflection and Submission

Write a brief reflection (around 300 words) addressing the following:

1. How does your rule-based system work?
2. What challenges did you encounter while prompting the AI to assist with the design and code?

### Deliverables:
1. A document with:
    - Three initial project ideas.
    - The rules/logic for your chosen system.
    - The results of three inputs to your system.
    - Your reflection.
2. Your Python code file (.py).
3. The requirements.txt file necessary to run your program.
4. Submit your results as a link to a GitHub repo containing these files.
