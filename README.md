# Building a Rule-Based AI System in Python project.
---

## Part 1: Initial Project Ideas

### Project Idea 1: Plant Disease Diagnostic Tool
- **Description:** A system where users describe symptoms in their plants, and the AI provides possible diseases and treatment recommendations. 
- **Rule-Based Approach:**  
  Uses decision trees with IF-THEN rules to match symptom descriptions with diseases.
  Keywords like "yellow leaves," "spots," or "wilting" trigger specific diagnostic paths.

### Project Idea 2: Movie Recommendation System
- **Description:** Suggests movies based on user preferences and criteria provided.
- **Rule-Based Approach:**  
  Rules match user inputs (genre preferences, mood, release year, length) against a database of movies, applying filters and priority rules.

### Project Idea 3: Diet Meal Planner
- **Description:** Creates meal suggestions based on dietary restrictions, preferences, and nutritional goals.  
- **Rule-Based Approach:**  
  Applies rules to filter food options based on constraints (allergies, calories, nutritional requirements) and generates compatible meal combinations.

### Chosen Idea: Movie Recommendation System 
**Justification:** I chose this idea because my friends, family, and I are always trying to decide on what to watch and this could help us decide. This project would be applicable to real-world scenarios and allow me to easily categorize movies to recommend based on rules and keywords.

## Part 2: Rules/Logic for the Chosen System

The **Movie Recommendation System** will function as follows:

1. **User Input Processing Rules:**  
  - **IF** user inputs genre preference
    Add genre to filter criteria
  - **IF** user specifies release year/period
    Add year range to filter criteria
  - **IF** user indicates mood (e.g., "happy", "scary", "thoughtful")
    Map mood to appropriate genres
  - **IF** user sets runtime preferences (e.g., "short", "long")
    Map to specific minute ranges
  - **IF** user mentions actors/directors
    Add to preference criteria

2. **Movie Filtering Rules:**  
  - **FOR EACH** movie in database:
    - IF movie.genre matches ANY user genre preferences
      - Add points to movie score
    - IF movie.year is within user's preferred time period
      - Add points to movie score
    - IF movie.runtime matches user preference
      - Add points to movie score
    - IF movie contains preferred actors/directors
      - Add points to movie score
    - IF user has previously liked similar movies
      - Add additional points

3. **Recommendation Logic:**  
  - SORT movies by score (highest to lowest)
  - SELECT top N movies from sorted list
  - IF no movies meet minimum threshold
    - Request additional preferences OR broaden search
  - RETURN personalized recommendation list with brief descriptions

4. **Implementation Details:**
  - Store movies in a structured format (dictionary or class)
  - Use keyword matching for processing natural language input
  - Implement scoring system (0-10) for each movie based on match quality
  - Track previous recommendations to avoid repetition
  - Include a feedback mechanism to refine future recommendations

5. **Enhancement Rules:**  
  - IF user rejects recommendation
    - Ask for reason and adjust preferences accordingly
  - IF user has watched >5 movies of a specific genre
    - Increase weight for that genre in recommendations
  - IF user consistently watches movies from specific era/director
    - Automatically prioritize similar content

## Part 4: Reflection

### Project Overview:
This rule-based movie recommendation system uses a series of logical rules rather than machine learning to provide personalized movie suggestions. The system maintains a collection of movies with attributes like title, year, genres, director, actors, runtime, and plot summary. The system gathers user preferences such as preferred genres, release year/period, runtime preferences, current mood, etc. through interactive prompts. Each movie is evaluated against user preferences using clearly defined rules and movies matching preferences earn points. Afterward, movies are sorted by score and the top-scoring options are presented with explanations of why they were recommended. Users can then adjust their preferences for new recommendations or start over completely.

### Challenges:
Surprisingly, I encountered no challenges when prompting the AI to create this project and Python code. Using the right prompts was a crucial aspect, but the AI model created a robust logical structure and well functioning code after only 1 prompt.
